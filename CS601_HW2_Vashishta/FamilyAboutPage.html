    <h2>Wife</h2>
    <p>
        My wife's name is Cheyenne. We met at Purdue, where she made the more logical decision to pursue computer
        engineering while I was stuck doing Mechanical Engineering.
        <br>
        Up until few days ago, she was working for Twitter, but due to Thanos snapping his finger, she ceased to exist
        in Twitter's database. She loves hiking, running and travelling with me.
        <br>
        Here you can see our recent trip to Hawaii that we had been saving up forever...

    <h2>Mother</h2>
    <p>
        My mother's name is Sangeeta. She was born in New Delhi India and pursued her bachelor's and masters in Finance.
        <br>
        Mad respect for the lady since she gave her career to make sure my brother and I had a good one.
        <br>
        I love my mother because of all the personal and emotional sacrifices she has made for me and also because she
        is genuinely an amazing person.
        <br>
        My wife loves her since they're reading and gossiping buddies.
        <br>
        Here is a picture of my mother in seattle hanging out with my wife and I.

    <!-- The third section -->
    <h3>Father</h3>
    <p>
        My father's name is Sanjeev. Just like my mother, he was also born in New Delhi, India and pursued his
        bachelor's and masters in Finance followed by an MBA.
        <br>
        He works for a medical company in India and has a busy job. My mother and father met in college (just like my
        wife and I).
        <br>
        In his free time, my father loves travelling.
        <br>
        Here is a picture of my father, my mother and I from my Indian wedding in Indianapolis (what a coincidence,
        Indian and Indianapolis, get it?)
        <br>

    <h4>Brother</h4>
    <p>
        My brother's name is Sanchay. He pursued his undergraduate degree in supply chain management from Penn State
        Univesity, a big 10 competitor for Purdue so BOOOOOO.
        <br>
        He currently works for Mylan Pharmaceuticals (Another person in the medical industry). My brother is more of a
        friend to me than a brother.
        <br>
        If we have a console around and FIFA, that's what you would find us play. Minutes turn into hours and hours can
        possibly turn into days playing FIFA.
        <br>
        Here is a picture of my brother and I hanging out in Olympic National park, WA.
